# when running rails console locally, you can pull down heroku's db instead of having to recreate from scratch:
# pull it using this command: heroku pg:pull HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_ONYX development --app we-the-pac
# the below setting ('database: development') is already configured to use the pulled heroku database
# if, instead, creating own db and not using pulled heroku db, change 'database: development' to 'database: db/development'

  database: development

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
