Following the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, Super PACs can spend unlimited amounts of money in US politics. Super PACs spent over $1 billion dollars in the 2012 election cycle alone. Clearly, for we the people, voting is no longer enough.

We the people need a way to hold our Representatives accountable!

We the PAC empowers citizens by allowing them to publicly declare their support for, or oppostion against, a Representative. When a user approves of a Representative's action, they can make a $1 pledge to their reelection. A tweet is sent to the Representative, including a user-submitted explanation for their pledge. Conversly, when a user disapproves of a Representative's action, they can subtract a $1 from their previous pledges. Another tweet is sent to the Representative, including another explanation. Periodically users make good on their word by fulfilling their pledges.

The goal is to empower what you can giveâ€“to take your vote beyond the ballot box. When you make a pledge, you have a public reason behind it. If money is speech, then We the PAC lets you put your money where your mouth is.
